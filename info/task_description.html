<p>
In this challenge, you will be given a result, and your task is to find the arithmetic expression using only
 the numbers pi and e that yields that result. You can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation,
 and each number (pi and e) can appear at most two times (parenthesis are excluded). If there are multiple solutions, return the
 one that comes first alphabetically (no spaces).
</p>


<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> The input must be a numerical value.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The output should be a string containing a valid
 arithmetic expression using only pi and e that evaluates to the input result.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
In challenges that require finding arithmetic expressions,
    we can discover interesting mathematical relationships. For example, one such relationship is
    the fact that the sum of the inverses of the square numbers is equal to pi squared divided by 6.
